Hello World! My name is Jose Salvador and I love Kpop
My favorites groups are IZ*ONE, Fromis_9 and Oh My Girl because Arin XD
I'm sad cuz rumors about IZ*ONE disbanding :c
At least we have Fromis_9 (almost any members are cute)
I enjoy watch them in vlive! checking out for updates every day
My bias from both groups are Jiheon and Yuri
but jang-wonyoung is very very cute!
I really enjoy watching fromis_9 members doing whatever on youtube
Baek Jiheon is my bias, I can't stand with her bright and cute smile :)
Roh Jisun is like a little doll, I love her ASMR videos
My bias from izone are Yuri, Wonyoung and Chaewon respectively
I feel bad when other members teases Yena because her "duck mouth"
I really love "aegyo" behaviour in IZONE!
